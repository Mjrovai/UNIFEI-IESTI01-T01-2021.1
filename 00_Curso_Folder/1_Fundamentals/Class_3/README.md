# Installing Jupyter Notebook & using of Google CoLab
You can run your notebook locally in your machine or in the web with Colab.

## Jupyter Notebook
The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
### Instalation 
You can install Jupyter Notebook using:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (better for begginers)
- Using PIP (You must have Python 3 installed)

The free 7' video "Installing Jupyter Notebook" that is part of Udemy's tutorial [Python and Jupyter Notebooks for beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-jupyter-notebooks-for-beginners/) can guide you on how to install and run notebooks on your machine.

## Google CoLab
Google Colaboratory or [CoLab] (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
zero configuration required, free access to GPUs and easy sharing. 

- Follow the [Tips_for_using_Colab](/00_Curso_Folder/1_Fundamentals/Class_3/Docs/Tips_for_using_Colab.pdf), to use it properly.
