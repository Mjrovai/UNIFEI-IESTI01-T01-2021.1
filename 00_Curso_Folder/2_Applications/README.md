# Going further with Machine Learning
Now that we finished the first part of the course, it is time to start appliying all the Machine Learning concepts on real TinyML applications. But before, let's try to help the students that would like to learn more about ML. The suggestions below are regarding online courses that are offered mainly by Coursera, EDX and Kaggle. All courses can be done by free (w/o certificate). 

## Python
First of all, everything starts with Python. Learning Python is not just a prerequisite for getting into machine learning, but it’s an investment that will help your career for the rest of your life.
The [Python for Everybody specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) offered by the University of Michigan is a great course. The specialization has 5 courses:
- Getting Started
- Data Structures
- Accessing Web Data
- Using Databases
- Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data

Another great course (in Portuguese) is [Introdução à Ciência da Computação com Python Parte 1 e 2](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/ciencia-computacao-python-conceitos)

## Machine Learning
Probably the most popular Machine Learning course in the world is [Machine Learning](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). With more than 4 million people enrolled, the course is taught by Andrew Ng and offered by Stanford.
This is not a course to focus on writing code, but in theory. The course covers the most important aspects of classical machine learning:
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Regularization
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems

Kaggle also has a very simple and short course about ML: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) and [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

## Deep Learning
The best [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearning-ai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=20210107-cs-ppt-coursera-welcome-dls) is also teached by Andrew Ng and offered by DeepLearning.AI  
There are 5 courses on this specialization:
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Sequence Models
